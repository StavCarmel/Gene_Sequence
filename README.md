# Gene_Sequence
Here is one of the functions I built for Bioinformatics and computational biology analysis 

this function extracts a gene's sequence out of a genome sequence accourding to the indices and strand to take out from.
It function creates the components of the gene's sequence - 5'UTR, ORF, 3'UTR.
